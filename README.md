# Biography
I'm currently a second-year master student in [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/) at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), advised by [Bo Du](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/teacherinfo.aspx?id=254). I received my B.S degree in computer science from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My research interests lies in __Reinforcement Learning__ and __Imitation Learning__. Specifically, I want to make reinforcement learning more pratical in real-world tasks by considering how to exploit imperfect demonstrations in imitation learning and batched reinforcement learning.
